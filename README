readToPsql.pl:

	Read Bro log file into a postgresql database. The name of the database has to
	be set in the script. Table is automatically generated according to the path
	value of the Bro log file.

	Usage: readToPsql.pl [logfile].

	Only use with one file at a time. To use with multiple files do

	find ./ -name "conn*.log" -print0 | xarg -0 -n1 readToPsql.pl

	or similar.


readToPsqlMassInserts.pl:

	Same as readToPsql.pl - it just uses regular inserts instead of COPIES. Might
	work better in a few special cases - but usually should not be used, because
	it is much, much slower.

readToInfobright.pl: 
	Very rough Infobright loader. Has hardcoded paths in it (search for /xc)
